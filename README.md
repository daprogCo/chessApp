# chessApp

My take on the classical portfolio chess app!

Note that it's my first shared project on GitHub and it's still a work in progress...
So please be indulgent, if you notice some noob errors!!!

Here's a link to try out the online build:

## About the App

Right now, the interface loaded on a browser let you move pieces in respect of the all chess rules.
Click first on the piece you want to move, and after click the space you want to move it to.
Pawn will always promote into a queen.
Game situation as Invalid Move, Checkmate or Stalemate is mentionned by a console message.

The choosen color will just determine the side that will be at the bottom of the screen.
You'll still have (for now...) to move pieces from the color whose turn it is.

The logical of the game is all program in Vanilla JavaScript and the rendering is handled in React.
Please feel free to comment, I'm always up to improve my work.
If you think, I should add comments in my code to facilitate the reading of it, please also tell me!

My goal is to be as professional and industry ready as possible!!!

Thanks you!!!
